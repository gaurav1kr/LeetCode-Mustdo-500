# Interview Questions and Answers for Distributed Cloud Storage System Design

## General Design Questions

### 1. What are the key components of your system?
**Answer**: The system includes:
- **Metadata Service**: Stores metadata like object size, location, and checksum.
- **Storage Service**: Handles object read/write operations.
- **Caching Service**: Speeds up frequent object access using an in-memory cache.
- **Replication Service**: Ensures fault tolerance through data replication.
- **Frontend Service**: Serves as the entry point for user requests.
- **Thread Pool**: Manages concurrency for handling multiple requests.

### 2. Why did you choose these services?
**Answer**: These services address scalability, performance, and fault tolerance:
- Caching improves read performance.
- Replication ensures data availability during failures.
- Thread pools optimize resource utilization.

### 3. What makes your system scalable?
**Answer**: The system scales by:
- Horizontally adding more storage nodes.
- Using thread pools to handle concurrent requests.
- Employing caching to reduce load on storage services.

### 4. How does your system handle faults?
**Answer**: Faults are handled by:
- **Replication**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes.
- **Metadata Service**: Keeps track of object locations to redirect requests to healthy nodes.
- **Caching**: Minimizes dependency on the storage service for frequently accessed data.

## Performance Questions

### 5. How does caching improve performance?
**Answer**: The caching service stores frequently accessed objects in memory, reducing the need for disk I/O. It uses an LRU policy to ensure that only relevant objects are cached.

### 6. How do you handle high write throughput?
**Answer**: The thread pool ensures requests are processed concurrently. Write operations are asynchronously replicated to other nodes, reducing latency for client responses.

### 7. How do you optimize read performance?
**Answer**: By:
- Using the caching service for frequent reads.
- Preloading popular objects into cache at startup.
- Parallelizing reads across multiple threads.

## Fault Tolerance and Data Consistency

### 8. What happens if a node storing replicas fails?
**Answer**: The metadata service maintains a list of replica locations. If one replica fails, the system retrieves the object from another replica.

### 9. How do you ensure consistency across replicas?
**Answer**: Writes are logged in the replication service. Replication is performed asynchronously, and a periodic reconciliation process ensures consistency.

### 10. What happens during a network partition?
**Answer**: The system allows reads from available replicas. Writes may fail temporarily until the partition is resolved, after which replication resumes.

## Concurrency and Multithreading

### 11. Why did you use a thread pool?
**Answer**: A thread pool manages a fixed number of threads, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each request. It also limits the maximum number of concurrent threads to prevent resource exhaustion.

### 12. How do you handle concurrent reads and writes?
**Answer**: Reads and writes are synchronized using locks or atomic operations. The caching layer ensures that multiple reads are served without locking unless a write is in progress.

## Replication and Availability

### 13. Why is replication asynchronous?
**Answer**: Asynchronous replication reduces write latency for clients. It ensures that data is eventually consistent while providing high availability.

### 14. How many replicas should be maintained?
**Answer**: Typically, 3 replicas are maintained for durability. This ensures data availability even if one or two replicas fail.

### 15. What happens if all replicas are out of sync?
**Answer**: A majority voting system or reconciliation process identifies the correct version of the data, based on timestamps or version numbers.

## Database and Schema

### 16. Why did you choose SQLite for metadata?
**Answer**: SQLite is lightweight, reliable, and easy to embed within the service. It provides sufficient performance for metadata operations in a distributed system.

### 17. How would you scale the metadata service?
**Answer**: Metadata can be sharded by object IDs or namespaces to distribute the load across multiple nodes.

### 18. How do you ensure the metadata schema is future-proof?
**Answer**: Schema evolution techniques like versioning and backward-compatible changes are used to accommodate new features.

## API and Client Interaction

### 19. What APIs does the system expose?
**Answer**: The system exposes RESTful APIs:
- `POST /object`: Upload an object.
- `GET /object/{id}`: Retrieve an object.
- `DELETE /object/{id}`: Delete an object.
- `GET /metadata/{id}`: Retrieve metadata.

### 20. How do clients handle errors?
**Answer**: The API returns HTTP status codes:
- `200 OK`: Success.
- `404 Not Found`: Object not found.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: System error.

## Code-Specific Questions

### 21. Why did you use STL containers in the code?
**Answer**: STL containers like `std::unordered_map` and `std::queue` provide efficient data structures for caching and task management, respectively.

### 22. How is multithreading implemented in the code?
**Answer**: Multithreading is implemented using `std::thread` and `std::mutex`. The thread pool processes tasks concurrently, synchronizing access to shared resources with locks.

### 23. What caching policy is used?
**Answer**: The cache uses an LRU-like policy, ensuring that frequently accessed objects are retained while older ones are evicted.

## System Limitations and Improvements

### 24. What are the limitations of your design?
**Answer**:
- Metadata service could become a bottleneck for large-scale operations.
- Asynchronous replication introduces eventual consistency, which might not be acceptable for some use cases.
- The system lacks advanced features like erasure coding for storage efficiency.

### 25. How would you improve the system?
**Answer**:
- Introduce a distributed metadata service.
- Use more robust databases like Cassandra for metadata.
- Add erasure coding for storage optimization.

### 26. How would you handle very large files?
**Answer**: Large files can be split into smaller chunks, stored across multiple nodes. Metadata tracks chunk locations for reconstruction.

## Scaling and Deployment

### 27. How would you scale the system?
**Answer**:
- Horizontally scale storage nodes.
- Shard metadata and cache services.
- Use load balancers to distribute client requests.

### 28. What deployment challenges do you anticipate?
**Answer**:
- Ensuring network reliability for replication.
- Configuring consistent replica placement.
- Monitoring and alerting for system health.

## Design Trade-Offs

### 29. Why did you prioritize replication over erasure coding?
**Answer**: Replication is simpler to implement and ensures high availability. Erasure coding offers better storage efficiency but adds computational overhead.

### 30. Why not use an existing distributed storage system?
**Answer**: This design is tailored for specific requirements. Existing solutions like S3 or HDFS might include unnecessary features, adding complexity.
